# ResNet-VQC
Small Quantum Computing research, using ResNet and Variational Quantum Computing(VQC) fusion to detecting Pneumonia on X-Ray scans.

[This paper](https://github.com/a3a256/ResNet-VQC/blob/main/Pneumonia%20Detection%20on%20X-Ray%20using%20ResNet%20and%20Quantum%20Computing.pdf) researched the effects of fusing classic ResNet50 and VQC on the task of image classification - detecting Pneumonia patients by chest X-Ray scans.

It compared two models trained in same conditions and training parameters:
* [Classic ResNet solution](https://github.com/a3a256/ResNet-VQC/blob/main/notebooks/Classic_ResNet50_Pneumonia.ipynb)
* [ResNet50 and VQC](https://github.com/a3a256/ResNet-VQC/blob/main/notebooks/ResNet50_VQC_Pneumonia.ipynb)
